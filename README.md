# Scraping-and-Crawling-nps.go
This is the second course project for my intermediate programming class.
I create a program to scrape and search for information about National Sites (Parks, Heritage Sites, Trails, and other entities) from https://www.nps.gov. I also add the ability to look up nearby places using the MapQuest API.
